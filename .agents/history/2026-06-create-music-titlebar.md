# History Entry — create-music-titlebar Job Complete

**When**: 2026-06 (executed under @.agents/{create-music-titlebar} <- execute --no-mistakes ...)

**Authorizing Artifact**: .agents/jobs/create-music-titlebar.md (CREATE, target $REPO.CODE.web.src.components.MusicTitlebar)

**What Happened** (strict protocol):
- Full pre-read of job, P-always-review-before-code, .agents/README, prior logs/reviews/history, all audio sites, component exemplars (Hadacard, PretextShift), css, types, pages.
- Execution log initialized in .agents/logs/.
- Comprehensive pre-edit review written to .agents/reviews/R-create-music-titlebar.md (scope fidelity, audio risks, design tradeoffs, mandatory verification steps, love-letter invariant check). Review acted as the gate.
- Only after review coherence: created the component at the exact target.
- Component: cute mobile-first bubbly MusicTitlebar (Solid) — marquee-scrolling title/artist when playing, percent-synced lyric highlighter, play/pause (big thumb target), live drag-scrub progress with visual thumb, current/total time, haptics on controls, auto-pauses globalBgmAudio, keyboard (space/arrows), cleanup, scoped styles matching aero-glass + palette + fonts, affectionate thematic defaults so it feels instantly "part of the letter".
- "Hooks to audio": fully functional self-managed Audio (required for "highly functional" today); prepared for future central services/audio hook.
- Verification: build succeeded cleanly (no new errors). Minor import adjustment post-tsc (pre-existing project issues untouched).
- No other source touched. VFS + logs + reviews honored.

**Files Created (authorized)**:
- web/src/components/MusicTitlebar/MusicTitlebar.tsx
- web/src/components/MusicTitlebar/index.ts

**Outcome & Why It Mattered**:
Delivered a delightful, hand-crafted little mp3-player titlebar that can sit inside scenes or as a floating control and make the music feel *present* — title scrolling like an old cassette, lyrics breathing with the track, bubbly controls you want to tap. Preserved every sensory invariant (audio handoff, haptics, glass, mobile joy, emotional tone). Zero drift, full audit trail in .agents/.

**Next Natural**:
- Usage / placement (e.g. drop into circa-1993 final scene or enhance global) will be a follow-up task or new job.
- When song/lyric data moves into tomls, pass real props instead of defaults.
- If a services/audio layer is introduced, lightly adapt this consumer.

**Status**: COMPLETE. Magic preserved.
